# TSScraper

The TSScraper is a reference generator and analysis tool for Torque Script is a tool that is capable of looking at 
arbitrary Torque Script projects (Tribes 2 mods in particular) and would generate a graph from this data that's then 
used for verifying the inheritance integrity, referential integrity and property integrity using a set of preprogrammed
rules that govern what values are valid for what properties.
